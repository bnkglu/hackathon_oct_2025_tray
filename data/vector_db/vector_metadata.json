Our purpose is to unite science, \ntechnology and talent to get ahead of disease together and \npositively impact the health of 2.5 billion people. We are \ndelivering against our purpose through our R&D based on science \nof the immune system and new technologies and leveraging our \nleadership in developing new vaccines and specialty medicines \nfor infectious diseases, HIV, respiratory/immunology and \noncology. \nWe understand that being a responsible business means getting \nahead of disease together in the right way. Environmental, social \nand governance (ESG) impacts are embedded in our strategy to  \nsupport our long-term growth, build trust with our stakeholders, \nreduce risk and deliver positive social impact.\nOur approach  is centred around six core areas: Access to \nhealthcare; global health and health security; environment; \ndiversity, equity and inclusion; ethical standards; and product \ngovernance. \nThis report sets out the progress we are making in each area and \nsupplements our Annual Report and the disclosures we publish on \nour website. \nWe measure our ESG progress through our ESG Performance \nRating, introduced in 2022 as one of our corporate key \nperformance indictors to drive performance and provide greater \ntransparency in our ESG reporting. The executive leadership team \nand the Board, via the Corporate Responsibility Committee, \nreview the metrics that make up this Rating each year to ensure \nthey are sufficiently challenging and ambitious.\nI am proud of the continued progress we have made this year, \nleveraging science, technology and talent to deliver a positive \nimpact on some of society\u2019s most urgent challenges. Our 2023 \nESG Performance Rating was \u2018on track\u2019 for the second \nconsecutive year. More details can be found on pages 5-8. The \nperformance against the metrics that contribute to this rating  \nand the overall ESG Performance Rating score have been \nindependently assured for 2023, along with other priority ESG \ndata in this report.\nOur 2023 performance included:   \n \u2013 Reaching 89 million people in lower income countries through \naccess partnerships\n \u2013 Gavi confirming the rollout of our malaria vaccine, Mosquirix,  \nin up to 12 countries in Africa \n \u2013  Progressed 11 global health pipeline assets for priority WHO \ndiseases and worked with partners to get ready to start phase \nIII trial for our promising candidate vaccine, M72/AS01E, \nagainst tuberculosis \n \u2013 Significant commitment to strengthening health security with 12 \nR&D projects targeting pathogens deemed \u2018critical\u2019 or \u2018urgent\u2019 \nby the WHO and the US CDC \n \u2013 Ready for phase III trials of a low-carbon version of our rescue \nmetered dose inhaler (MDI) medication, Ventolin, to begin in \n2024 with the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nfrom the use of this inhaler by 90% \u2013 important as our Scope 3 \nemissions increased in 2023 due to increased sales of this \nproduct   \n \u2013 Decreased overall water use by 24% and by 11% for sites in high \nwater-stress regions, against our 2020 baseline\n \u2013 At the end of the year, women held 45% of VP-and-above roles \nglobally, and we had 35.7% ethnically diverse leaders at \nVP-and-above in the US and 18.4% ethnically diverse leaders at \nVP-and-above in the UK \n \u2013 Set out new AI principles to shape how we use AI and machine \nlearning to transform R&D in a way that is safe, ethical and \nresponsible\nWe continue to be recognised for our sector-leading ESG \nperformance. In 2023, we ranked 1st in the S&P Global Corporate \nSustainability Assessment for the pharmaceutical industry, and \nmaintained leading scores in the MSCI, ISS Corporate Rating and \nSustainalytics ESG ratings.\nWe keep our approach to ESG under constant review, responding \nto our operating environment as it evolves. This includes the \nrapidly changing ESG regulatory landscape and expectations of \ncompanies\u2019 ESG disclosures. In 2023, we began necessary \npreparations for new sustainability reporting requirements, \nincluding the EU\u2019s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive \n(CSRD), and committed to adopt TNFD-aligned disclosures \nbased on 2025 data. \nWe look forward to delivering further strong ESG performance \nalongside our improving outlook for sustained growth through  \nthe decade.   \nEmma Walmsley \nChief Executive Officer\nCEO\u2019s statement\nWe are pleased to report sector-leading ESG performance in 2023.",

That\u2019s why \nESG is embedded in our strategy and supports our sustainable \nperformance and long-term growth. It helps us to build trust  \nwith and generate value for our stakeholders, reduce risk to our \noperations and create positive social impact.\nWe have identified six ESG focus areas that address what is most \nmaterial to our business and the issues that matter the most to our \nstakeholders. These focus areas are core to our strategy and are \nwhere we can have the greatest positive impact on some of \nsociety\u2019s most urgent challenges, including those set out in the  \nUN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). \nThey are: \n \u2013 Access to healthcare\n \u2013 Global health and health security\n \u2013 Environment\n \u2013 Diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)\n \u2013 Ethical standards \n \u2013 Product governance\nThese focus areas were informed by our most recent materiality \nassessment in 2022, which reaffirmed that the most material \nissues for our business were well aligned with our six ESG focus \nareas. We recognise that being a responsible business is not a \nstatic requirement. We began work on our double materiality \nassessment, which will be completed in 2024. This means that we \nwill continue to evolve our approach in response to the rapidly \nchanging operating environment and strive for continuous \nimprovement to ensure we maintain strong ESG performance. \n gsk.com: Our materiality assessment  \nOur contribution to the UN SDGs \nThe United Nations' 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  \nset out a vision for ending poverty, hunger and inequality, and \nprotecting the planet\u2019s natural resources, by 2030. The six ESG \nareas that we have identified, and which are core to our strategy, \nare where we can have the greatest positive impact on some of \nsociety\u2019s most urgent challenges, including those set out in the \nSDGs. As a global biopharma company, we can make the most \nsignificant contribution to SDG3: Good Health and Wellbeing.  \nWe publish our contribution to the SDGs on our website. \n gsk.com: Our contribution to the SDGs\nStakeholder engagement \nOur approach to ESG is guided by continuous engagement  \nwith our stakeholders. Our key stakeholders include our patients, \nshareholders, customers and employees. We undertake formal \nmateriality assessments every two-to-three years and engage \nwith our stakeholders to ensure that our ESG focus areas continue \nto address the most material issues for our business. \nHow we engage with our stakeholders is covered throughout  \nthis report. This includes engagement with our people (see page \n8), our partnerships with NGOs and our membership of cross-\nindustry collaborations. \nWe also discuss our engagement with stakeholders in our Annual \nReport, which includes how our Board considers stakeholders in \ndecision-making. (See our section 172 statement on page 123). \nFor more information on our approach to stakeholder \nengagement, see our policies and publications on gsk.com. \n gsk.com: Materiality \u2022 Engaging with patient organisations  \u2022 Engaging \nwith healthcare professionals  \u2022 Investors hub \u2013 ESG\nESG governance \nOur ESG performance is monitored regularly by both our Board-\nlevel Corporate Responsibility Committee (CRC) and the GSK \nLeadership Team (GLT). The CRC oversees our progress against \nour commitments, including performance and how we are \nmeeting the expectations of our stakeholders. It collaborates with \nother Board committees, such as the Remuneration Committee \nand the Audit & Risk Committee, to ensure that ESG performance \nis integrated across the business. \nThe GLT and senior management are responsible for delivery \nagainst our six focus areas, and report regularly to the CRC on \nprogress (see pages pages 128-129 of our Annual Report).\nESG-aligned remuneration \nIn 2022, the Remuneration Committee, with the support of the \nCRC, introduced ESG performance measures into both our \nshort- and long-term incentive plans, to reward delivery of key \nESG measures. The ESG element consists of: human capital \nmanagement in the form of diversity, equity and inclusion \naspirations, which forms 10% of the annual bonus opportunity for \nthe GLT; and our climate and nature ambitions, which form 10% of \nour long-term incentive plan opportunity for senior leaders. These \nmetrics align to our ESG Performance Rating.

The rating is one of our corporate KPIs \nand measures progress against key metrics aligned to each of  \nour six focus areas. In 2023, this included 22 metrics, which are \nsummarised on pages 6-8. \nWe continue to evolve our ESG Performance Rating to ensure it \nmeets the expectations of our stakeholders. The executive \nleadership team and the Board, via the Corporate Responsibility \nCommittee, review the metrics that make up this Rating each year \nto ensure they are sufficiently challenging and ambitious. This \nyear, we have removed two metrics, relating to Access and Ethical \nstandards, and added one relating to antimicrobial (AMR) \nresistance. We met one of our 2022 metrics relating to Access by \ndeveloping and publishing pricing and access principles so it is no \nlonger required. We have also removed one of our Ethical \nstandards metrics that tracks the number of employees leaving \nGSK for misconduct. Increases or decreases in this number could \nindicate either a higher/lower number of breaches or stronger/\nweaker enforcement of our processes, so setting a threshold is not \nan effective measure for success in upholding our standards. We \ncontinue to monitor this data internally and publish it externally \n(see page 32). We have three additional metrics which provide a \nstrong measure of our commitment to ethical standards. We have \nadded a metric within Global health and health security, focused \non AMR. AMR is an urgent public health threat, and we have seen \nincreased stakeholder interest in our approach. We updated our \nbiodiversity target which measured the number of high risk \nmaterials implementing sustainable sourcing roadmaps as we \nachieved it in 2022. Our new target focuses on deforestation free \nsourcing of paper and palm oil. \nHow we assess performance\nThe GLT is accountable for delivering progress against our ESG \nmetrics and regularly reviews performance along with the Board\u2019s \nCRC. This helps to ensure that accountability for ESG performance \nis embedded within the business. Each individual metric is \nassessed as either: on track (the metric has been met or \nexceeded); on track with work to do (at least 80% of the metric  \nhas been achieved); or off track (metric has been missed by  \nmore than 20%). \nWe calculate the overall ESG Performance Rating by aggregating \nperformance across all metrics into a single score to illustrate \nwhether we are on track, on track with work to do, or off track.  \nThis rating is defined below:\nOn track: 70% or more of all metrics are on track\nOn track with work to do: more than 50% of all metrics are either \non track, or on track with work to do\nOff track: more than 50% of all metrics are off track\nOur approach continued\nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

By having access to senior global leaders \nfrom the beginning of their career with us, we aim to provide a \nmore intimate connection to GSK and the patients we serve, \ncreating emotional connection with our purpose, strategy and \nculture, to complement ongoing local onboarding activities.\nSupporting our people managers \nOur people managers play a crucial role in helping their teams to \nthrive and connecting the contributions the team makes to the \npatient and GSK's broader impact. We expect people managers \nto motivate, focus, care for and develop their teams and we \ndeliver training anchored in these four areas. In 2023 all of our VPs \nwere invited to attend a four day in-person event called Leading \nLeaders, a programme to help leaders bring out the best in their \nteams and foster the culture we need to succeed together. We \nalso continue to invest in growing the next generation of senior \nleaders to support our talent and succession needs through \nbespoke development interventions, equipping them with \nleadership skills for the future. \nMaintaining momentum on diversity, equity  \nand inclusion \nWe are continuing our focus on building a more diverse \norganisation and an equitable and inclusive culture so that \neveryone feels welcome, valued and included. By taking steps to \nensure equal opportunity and non-discrimination, we are \ndelivering on our ambition to make our leadership and teams \nmore diverse and inclusive. We support development for all with \nnumerous offerings for our employees, including an award-\nwinning leadership development programme, Accelerating \nDifference. Also, all our people complete a mandatory DEI \nmodule as part of our annual training, this year focused on how to \ncreate an inclusive workplace so all our people can thrive. \nFor more details on our DEI aspirations, see the Responsible \nBusiness section on page Error!

These include: a \nglobal minimum standard of 18 weeks\u2019 parental leave for primary \nand secondary carers for all forms of family, a global minimum \nstandard for care of a family member for end of life or serious \nhealth emergencies, insured benefits to include same-sex \npartners wherever possible, and mental health training \u2013 \navailable to everyone. We have also enhanced our financial \nwellbeing support for employees by introducing the \u2018nudge\u2019 \nfinancial education platform in over 50 countries, helping people \nmanage their finances and achieve their financial goals.\nIn 2023 we reignited volunteering across the company, focused on \nour ambition and charitable investment themes (Health for \npeople, Health for the planet, Innovators for the future). All \nemployees can volunteer for one or two days each year by taking \npart in team-based hands-on \u2018Together Days\u2019 or through skills-\nbased volunteering. A smaller number of people can volunteer up \nto four days each year for selected skills-based volunteering \nprojects.  \nPerformance with Choice \nPerformance with Choice, our approach to hybrid working for \nthose in office-based roles (about a quarter of our people), allows \nthe right balance of on-site and remote working. We are clear in \nour expectations that people take accountability to spend \nenough time together in person, while maintaining flexibility, to \nhelp us continue to build our sense of community and \nconnectedness, enable development and achieve our Ahead \nTogether ambitions. Data from our annual employee survey shows \nbroad support for our approach and expectations. \nRecognising and rewarding our people \nSharing our success and recognising and rewarding our people \nequitably, not just on the progress we have made but how we \nhave made it, continues to be an important part of our culture. In \naddition to our bonus scheme that rewards performance across \nthe company, each year we award 10% of our people with extra \n\u2018Ahead Together\u2019 awards for delivering exceptional performance \nin line with being accountable for their impact, ambitious for \npatients and doing the right thing. And we identify 5% of people \nas having missed performance for those not delivering on their \nobjectives or living the culture. \nHow our people experience GSK \nTo ensure we continue to listen to our people, we regularly \nmeasure their experience of GSK as a place to work. This includes \nan annual survey for all employees featuring questions on \nengagement, confidence, inclusivity, our culture focus areas and \ntrust priorities. We are proud that our engagement levels \nremained high at 81% in 2023. We also continue to see high \nscores with positive upward trends in confidence in delivery of our \nstrategy and our culture focus areas \u2013 ambitious for patients, \naccountability for impact and doing the right thing \u2013 as well as \nmeasures of inclusion. In 2023 we expanded analysis of the survey \nto understand differences in employee experience across diverse \ncharacteristics. We continue to make good progress in creating a \nculture and workplace where people feel a sense of belonging \nand can thrive.\nTo measure the effectiveness of our global managers, their teams \nprovide feedback through an annual One80 survey and \nmanagers receive anonymised aggregate feedback.

To help achieve this, we have a goal to \nreach 1.3 billion people in lower income countries with our \nmedicines and vaccines. We will do this by making our products \navailable at prices that are affordable for patients and \nsustainable for our business. \nIt takes significant time, risk and investment to successfully \ndiscover and develop new medicines and vaccines.

We involve the patient in the development of our \nmedicines and vaccines to identify real-world disease challenges. \nWe set responsible prices in line with the benefits we bring to \npatients and health systems, measured by clinical, economic and \nsocial outcomes. We compare our offer to what is already available \nfor patients and we generate evidence from clinical trials to \nestablish the added value provided by our medicines and vaccines. \nWe adjust our pricing in line with the socio-economic status of a \ncountry to ensure affordability and availability. This includes using \ntiered pricing for vaccines that address public health priorities in  \nlow and middle income countries based on the World Bank gross \nnational income classification. ViiV Healthcare provides non-profit \npricing for antiretroviral medicines for HIV for use in public health \nprogrammes in all low-income, least developed and Sub-Saharan \nAfrican countries. We work within existing payer systems and \nrecognise the need to balance health budgets for the societies  \nwe serve. \nWe recognise health inequities, including in higher income \ncountries, and fund dedicated activities to reach underserved \npopulations. These include disease education and helping \nuninsured and underinsured patients to navigate health benefits, \nas well as access programmes to provide financial and disease \nmanagement support. In the US, for example, we provided \nprescribed medicines and vaccines to more than 71,000 low-\nincome uninsured, underinsured and Medicare Part D patients  \nin 2023, through GSK and ViiV Healthcare\u2019s Patient Assistance \nPrograms Foundation.\nWe operate under robust pricing approvals, developing access \nplans informed by payers.

Developed by GSK and our partners, \nMosquirix is a significant scientific breakthrough \u2013 it is the world\u2019s \nfirst malaria vaccine and the first vaccine against any human \nparasite. \nIn July 2023, Gavi announced that up to nine African countries  \nare to be allocated doses of Mosquirix from early 2024. In early \n2024, Cameroon and Burkina Faso became the first countries to \nintroduce the vaccine into routine immunisation programmes.  \nWe have committed to supply 18 million doses to Gavi-eligible \ncountries between 2023 and 2025, with a plan to produce 15 \nmillion doses annually from 2026 to 2028. \nTo significantly increase supply of the vaccine in the medium term, \nwe are transferring technology know-how to Bharat Biotech of \nIndia, which will be the sole supplier of the vaccine from 2029. We \ncontinue to make good progress on this product transfer.\nIn 2023, results from a landmark study by the London School of \nHygiene & Tropical Medicine showed that combining Mosquirix \nwith antimalarial drugs in areas of Africa with seasonal malaria \nreduced malaria cases and deaths in young children over a \nperiod of five years. These findings confirm the potential of \nseasonal vaccination to provide a high level of protection over  \nthe first five years of life, when this protection is much needed. \nStrengthening healthcare systems \nWe collaborate with partners to strengthen healthcare systems, \nwhich is key to addressing systemic issues which reduce access  \nto healthcare, vaccines and treatments and which perpetuate \nhealth inequalities in lower income countries. We work with people \nand underserved communities to make sure that they take the \nlead in the decisions that affect them and their health, and we \nhelp support emergency preparedness and response. \nWe work in partnership with organisations that are active within \nlocal communities and look to catalyse additional resources to \nincrease impact. In 2023, GSK and ViiV Healthcare joined forces \nwith The Global Fund to pledge $7.5 million over three years to \ncreate the Gender Equality Fund, which will support community-\nbased and -led organisations that are working to deliver lasting \nchanges in health policies and programmes, transform gender \nnorms and eliminate discrimination to improve health outcomes, \nwith a  focus on TB, HIV and malaria. The Gates Foundation has \ncommitted to match this donation, in support of The Global \nFund's work.  \nMobilised and connected community-based organisations are a \nvital part of health systems, enabling access to and delivery of \nservices, especially for hard-to-reach populations. Positive Action, \nViiV Healthcare's community grant-giving programme, works \ndirectly with the communities most affected by HIV to further the \nViiV Healthcare mission of ensuring no person living with HIV is \nleft behind. In 2023, Positive Action invested more than \u00a312 million, \nreaching approximately 514,000 people and providing 99 grants \nacross 31 countries.\nIn September, we announced that we have renewed our \npartnership with Save the Children for another five years. To date, \nthe partnership has provided more than 3.5 million children with \nessential healthcare, trained and equipped more than 39,000 \nhealth workers in the most remote and marginalised communities, \nand advocated for the incorporation of stronger policies to \nprotect children\u2019s health at country and global level. \nBuilding on learnings over the last decade, we are focusing our \npartnership on reducing the number of \u2018zero dose\u2019 children \u2013 \nthose who have never received a vaccine \u2013 in Ethiopia and \nNigeria, which represent more than a third of the zero-dosed \nchildren in Africa. \nLast year, we launched two new programmes as part of our \nlong-standing partnership with Amref Health Africa. One focuses \non malaria in Kenya and Zambia, and the second will address \nanti-microbial resistance (AMR) across the region. It will work with \nWHO Regional Office for Africa and the African CDC to identify \nand assess national AMR plans and support their implementation.  \nGSK and ViiV Healthcare are committed to responding to \nhumanitarian crises where possible. To date, GSK has donated \nmore than \u00a36 million to a number of partners, including the Red \nCross, Save the Children and The Global Fund, directly responding \nto the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine and neighbouring countries. \nIn 2023, ViiV Healthcare continued to donate antiretroviral \nmedicines to national HIV and AIDS programmes in Poland to \nsupport people living with HIV who have been affected by the \nconflict in Ukraine. To date, the company has donated more  \nthan 10,000 packs. Positive Action also launched its Ukraine \nEmergency Response Fund.

More than \nthree-quarters were of children under five. To date, together with \nour partners, we\u2019ve brought two products for the prevention and \ntreatment of malaria to market \u2013 the world\u2019s first vaccine against \nmalaria (see Access, page 10), and a single-dose, radical cure for  \nP. vivax malaria as reported in 2022. Getting ahead of malaria is \nparticularly challenging due to growing resistance to existing drugs \nand insecticides and as climate change enables the spread of the \ndisease, so we are investing to develop the next generation of \ntransformative tools. \nIn August 2023, we announced that GSK scientists had discovered \na strain of a naturally occurring bacterium that could potentially \nhelp eradicate the disease. The Tres Cantos 1 (TC1) strain of the \nDelftia tsuruhatensis bacterium \u2013 named after the GSK R&D \nfacility where it was discovered \u2013 significantly reduces the load of \nP. falciparum malaria parasites in mosquitoes. This could \npotentially inhibit transmission of the parasite to humans. TC1 was \nshown to be effective in multiple types of Anopheles mosquito \nand against multiple types of malaria parasite. The ground-\nbreaking research was conducted in collaboration with the Johns \nHopkins Malaria Research Institute at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg \nSchool of Public Health. \nIt also used data from semi-field studies conducted with the Institut \nde Recherche en Sciences de la Sant\u00e9 (IRSS) in a contained \n\u2018MosquitoSphere\u2019 facility in Burkina Faso. This suggests that the \nlaboratory findings could be successfully translated to  \nthe field for malaria control. We continue to pursue this ground-\nbreaking research while engaging with global health institutions \nand partners to identify the most effective and sustainable \napproach for development and mobilisation if successful.\nSupporting innovation through capacity and \ncapability building\nThrough our Africa Open Lab initiative, launched in 2014, we \nsupport early-career scientists based in sub-Saharan Africa,  \nwith a focus on infectious diseases that disproportionately affect \nsub-Saharan populations, such as malaria, TB and AMR. In 2023, \nwe agreed grants to ten researchers in six countries in sub-Saharan \nAfrica and we announced a further call for proposals in November. \nWe are also working with African academic institutions to provide \ngrantees with supplemental training in areas including \nepidemiology, statistics and clinical research. \nStrengthening health security \nThere are many factors that can jeopardise our health security \n\u2013 from new and emerging infectious diseases to the rise of AMR. \nClimate change and nature loss also can change disease \npatterns. We are using our scientific know-how and collaborating \nwith others to help the world better prepare for future health \nchallenges.\nGetting ahead of AMR through innovation and \nappropriate use \nFounded on GSK\u2019s science and technology, our primary \ncontribution to strengthening health security is through our \ninnovation to prevent and mitigate infectious disease. This \nincludes investing in innovation to get ahead of infections where \nnew antimicrobials and vaccines are urgently needed. We have \nmore than 30 R&D projects across medicines and vaccines  \nthat are relevant to AMR, ranging from early- to late-stage \ndevelopment, with  12 R&D projects targeting pathogens deemed \n\u2018critical\u2019 or \u2018urgent\u2019 by the WHO and the US CDC. \nThese include gepotidacin, which could be the first novel oral \nantibiotic treatment for uncomplicated urinary tract infections \n(uUTIs) in over 20 years. Positive phase III data from the EAGLE-2 \nand EAGLE-3 phase III trials were presented at the European \nCongress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in \nCopenhagen in April 2023. Through our partnership with Spero \nTherapeutics, Inc., we have an exclusive licence agreement for \ntebipenem HBr, a late-stage oral carbapenem antibiotic with the \npotential to treat complicated urinary tract infections (cUTIs). \nIn December 2023, the first patient was dosed in PIVOT-PO, our \npivotal phase III trial for tebipenem. If approved, tebipenem HBr \nwill address an unmet medical need for a novel oral antibiotic as \nan alternative to intravenous hospital therapy for drug-resistant \ncUTIs. In March 2023, we announced an exclusive licence \nagreement with Scynexis for Brexafemme (ibrexafungerp tablets), \na first-in-class antifungal for the treatment of vulvovaginal \ncandidiasis (VVC) and for reduction in the incidence of recurrent \nVVC. \nVaccines remain an important pathway to getting ahead of \nresistant infections. During the year, the US FDA granted a  \nFast Track designation for our investigational vaccine against \ngonorrhoea \u2013 which is the second most prevalent bacterial \nsexually transmitted infection worldwide, with an estimated 82 \nmillion new cases globally each year. It is recognised as an urgent \nunmet medical need due to its growing global incidence and \nreduced efficacy of available treatments as drug-resistant strains \nare increasing.\nSee page 30 of our Annual Report for more about our R&D \npipeline. \nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

This was primarily due to energy efficiency measures \nand increasing the amount of renewable electricity we use. For \nexample, our Nashik site in India has reduced its emissions by 93% \nsince 2020, by moving to renewable biomass for heat and to \nrenewable electricity. \nAs a member of the RE100 initiative, we have committed to reach \n100% of our imported electricity from renewable sources by 2025 \nand 100% of all electricity we generate and import from \nrenewable sources by 2030. In 2023, we reached 83% imported \nrenewable electricity, an increase of 10% from 2022. \nWe signed a power purchase agreement to source  renewable \nelectricity to cover 50% of our electricity demand for our sites in \nEurope from mid-2026. Two additional wind turbines and the new \nsolar farm at our manufacturing facility in Irvine, Scotland began \ngenerating renewable energy.\nWe seek to follow leading practice in laboratory sustainability. In \n2023, seven of our laboratories in the United States, Canada and \nthe UK achieved My Green Lab Certification, which is considered \nthe gold standard for laboratory sustainability best practices \naround the world, covering community engagement, energy, water, \nwaste and resource management. Three of these received the \nhighest level of certification. We now have ten laboratories certified \nacross our network with a further ten in the assessment process.\nWe are a member of EV100 and are committed to transition 100% \nof our fleet to electric or hybrid vehicles and to install chargers at 100 \nof our sites by 2030. Plug-in-hybrid or fully electric vehicles made up \n6% of our sales fleet and 16% of our total fleet in 2023. We have \nchargers at 30 major sites and have increased the number of \ncharging points to nearly 500. \nAddressing our Scope 3 emissions\nOur overall Scope 3 emissions are 10% lower than our baseline \nyear of 2020, although there was a 4% increase in 2022 (our latest \navailable data) compared with 2021. This was primarily driven by \nhigher sales of metered dose inhaler products.  We set out below \nthe steps we are taking to reduce the emissions associated with \nmetered dose inhalers. Although overall Scope 3 emissions \nincreased from 2021 to 2022, in the same period, we reduced \nupstream Scope 3 emissions from our suppliers, see more below.\nSupply chain emissions \nThe goods and services we buy to make our medicines and \nvaccines, and additional upstream emissions, account for \napproximately 31% of our total carbon emissions footprint. In 2023, \nour supply chain emissions fell by 2%.\nOur Sustainable Procurement Programme requires our suppliers \nto take action on both climate and nature. At the same time, we \nactively support our suppliers to adopt new environmental \nsustainability measures, with a particular focus on the top 30 \nsuppliers by climate and nature impact.  \nWe have started to include contract clauses on carbon reductions \nfor these priority suppliers. In 2023, 23% of our top 30 suppliers by \ncarbon emissions have submitted science based targets for \nvalidation, and eight of those have had the targets approved. In \n2023, we completed deep-dives for two of our key suppliers to \nidentify opportunities to reduce energy and water usage and \nswitch to renewable energy sources.\nWe are also engaging more broadly across our supply chain.  \nIn May 2023, as part of our Supplier Forum, attended by 56 \nsuppliers, we held three sustainability roundtables focused on \naddressing common challenges and potential solutions. We \nlaunched the Sustainability Foundations programme in January \n2023 with over 50 GSK procurement employees attending three \nhours of training, focused on climate and nature. Participants \nreported a 60% increase in confidence and competence in \nexplaining our ambition to suppliers and ensuring our \nenvironmental goals are aligned. \nSupply chain emissions are a shared challenge for our sector,  \nso we are working in collaboration across our industry through \nprogrammes like Activate, Energize and the Sustainable Markets \nInitiative (SMI) Health Systems Task Force, to find solutions.\nTo date, 10 of our top 30 suppliers by carbon emissions have \nregistered to join the Activate programme focused on reducing \nemissions from the production of active pharmaceutical \ningredients. \nIn July, our CEO signed an open letter alongside other healthcare \nleaders in the SMI Health Systems Task Force, calling on our \nsuppliers to sign-up to the joint minimum climate and \nsustainability targets set by the Task Force. \nIn December, My Green Lab launched Converge, a collaborative \nsupply chain initiative to encourage suppliers to reduce the \nenvironmental impact of labs in their value chain. GSK is one of \nthe founding sponsors of the initiative. \nEmissions from the use of our products \nThe use of our medicines and vaccines makes up 57% of our total \nfootprint. Most of this is from the propellant used in metered-dose \ninhalers for asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease \n(COPD). \nGSK\u2019s rescue metered dose inhaler (MDI) medication, Ventolin \n(salbutamol) is an essential medicine prescribed to approximately \n35 million people with respiratory conditions worldwide. Patient \nuse of this inhaler, due to the current propellant, accounts for just \nunder half (48%) of our carbon footprint. We are investing in a \nlow-carbon programme with the potential to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions from the inhaler by 90% by transitioning to a next \ngeneration, lower-carbon propellant. Phase III trials will begin in \n2024 and, if successful, regulatory submissions will start in 2025. \nThis is to supplement our existing low carbon dry powder inhalers.\nClimate-related financial disclosures \nSee pages 62-70 in our Annual Report for our disclosure on \nclimate risk and resilience in line with the Task Force on Climate-\nrelated Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework.\nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

It sets out how we approach action on nature through four \nfocus areas \u2013 freshwater, land, oceans and atmosphere \u2013 \nincluding the biodiversity of living species across these areas. 1  \nWe aim to deliver our contribution in three ways: avoiding or \nreducing our impact on nature, protecting and restoring nature, \nand helping to accelerate collaborative action. This approach is \naligned with the work of the Taskforce on Nature-related \nFinancial Disclosures (TNFD) and the Science Based Target \nNetwork (SBTN). \nThe overuse of natural resources and the generation of waste and \npollution are key drivers of nature loss, so we have also set \nunderlying targets on waste and materials.\nIn May 2023, we were selected to be part of the first group of \ncompanies to participate in the initial target validation process \nwith SBTN to set validated science-based targets for nature, \nstarting with targets for freshwater and land, followed by targets \nfor oceans and biodiversity. These targets will focus on locations \nacross our value chain where nature is particularly under pressure. \nTNFD published its final framework in September \u2013 an outcome \nof the pilot framework that we and others were already testing. \nWe announced our commitment to adopting TNFD-aligned \ndisclosures in 2026, based on 2025 data.

Our primary impact on water availability is through our \nmanufacturing sites located in areas of water-stress.\n100% of our sites are good water stewards, in line with the Alliance \nfor Water Stewardship\u2019s definition. In 2023, we started the Alliance \nfor Water Stewardship Standards certification process for our five \nwater-stressed sites in Algeria, India and Pakistan. The site teams \nhave passed their training on the Standard and are working to \nimplement it by 2025.\nWe achieved our overall water reduction target in 2022. In 2023,  \nwe reduced overall water use in our operations by an additional \n1% compared with 2022 and by 6% in sites in high water-stress \nregions. This is a decrease of 24% for overall water use and 11% for \nsites in high water-stress regions against our 2020 baseline. \nWe have implemented water efficiency and reuse systems at a \nnumber of our sites, including Pakistan, which is increasing its \nrecycled water capacity. At our Wavre site in Belgium, a pilot \nwastewater treatment station has been installed to enable reuse \nof our wastewater to reduce water consumption. \nFor our sites and key suppliers located in water-stressed areas, we \nare developing catchment-level water replenishment, restoration \nand regeneration projects to deliver our water neutrality target. \nWe have partnered with a local NGO, Watershed Organisation \nTrust (WOTR), in Nashik, India on a water replenishment project \ndesigned to improve ecosystem conditions, enhance the climate \nresilience of local agriculture, and help local villages manage \nwater resources to improve their health and livelihoods. \nWe are also a founding partner of the Women + Water \nCollaborative in India, which launched in October 2023, working \nwith the Water Resilience Coalition, an initiative between the UN  \nGlobal Compact and the Pacific Institute. This programme brings \ntogether companies from different sectors to leverage women\u2019s \nleadership to improve access to clean water and sanitation, \nultimately supporting the health of local communities. \nWe are committed to ensuring that discharges from the \nmanufacturing of APIs, including antibiotics, do not adversely affect \npeople or the environment. In 2023, 87% of all sites and key suppliers \nwere compliant with AMR Alliance and API Wastewater discharge \nlimits, down from 94% in 2022. This is driven by us expanding our \nscope to include more API suppliers which led to a decrease in the \npercentage of key suppliers that were confirmed to be within \nWastewater API discharge limits. We are now engaging with these \nadditional suppliers to assess their alignment with discharge limits, \nand support improvements where necessary. 100% of GSK sites \nwere within AMR Alliance and Wastewater API quality limits.\nTo support the responsible manufacturing of antibiotics, we work \nwith the AMR Industry Alliance to set global limits for wastewater \nantibiotic discharges from factories.

    "original_content": "21 GSK ESG Performance Report 2023\nMarch 2024\nEnvironment continued\nLand degradation, due to poor land management or land \nconversion, can have a range of negative health impacts. Our \nprimary dependency on land is through the natural materials we \nsource, some of which derive from agricultural commodities. Their \nproduction can drive deforestation and land-use change. \nDuring 2023, we completed baseline assessments for six sites, \nmeaning we have now assessed all our sites, using the Natural \nEngland Biodiversity Net Positive methodology. In parallel, we \nhave plans in place to improve biodiversity at nine of our sites, an \nincrease of six from 2022. \nIn May 2023, we set out ambitious new Sustainable Sourcing \nStandards for suppliers who provide us with materials that are \nhighly dependent on nature, like lactose, gelatine and soy. The \nstandards, developed in collaboration with third-party experts, \naim to support these suppliers to assess, improve and verify their \napproach to addressing a range of nature impacts \u2013 and \nassociated climate and social impacts \u2013 including land-use,  \nwater stewardship and biodiversity.\nWe have roadmaps in place which aim to achieve 100% \nsustainably-sourced paper packaging and palm oil by 2025. In \n2023, 86% of our paper packaging was derived from certified \nsources or from recycled raw materials and 98% of our core palm \noil materials were certified by third parties as being from \nsustainable sources. To further improve our Palm Oil sourcing \npractices, we have joined Action for Sustainable Derivatives, an \nindustry-led collaboration to tackle environmental and social \nsupply chain issues around palm oil derivatives. \nWhile working with suppliers is a key part of our goal to reduce  \nour impact on nature, where appropriate we will also look at \nopportunities to reduce or avoid the use of some natural materials, \nfor example through process efficiencies and synthetic \nalternatives. For example, an extract from the soapbark tree is an \nessential ingredient in vaccine adjuvants, which are used to \nenhance the immune response of vaccines. We are working on a \nprocess improvement to deliver a significant yield increase, \nreducing our nature impact and improving supply resilience.\n gsk.com: Our approach to sourcing materials that are highly  \ndependent on nature \nOceans \nWe continue to deliver on our existing ocean target (set out \nbelow), and will apply the relevant science-based methodology \non oceans when it becomes available.\nTarget\n \u2013 100% of marine-derived materials to be sustainably sourced  \nby 2030 \nDegradation of the world\u2019s oceans, caused by factors such as climate \nchange, marine pollution and over-fishing, poses risks to human \nhealth and business resilience. Our impacts and dependencies on \noceans come primarily from marine-derived materials that are a \ncritical part of manufacturing vaccines and medicines. \nFor example, we use horseshoe crab blood, which is an important \nsubstance that is required by some regulators to be used in \npharmaceutical and biomedical quality control processes to \nensure the quality and safety of medicines, vaccines and devices. \nWe continue to make progress on volume reductions, and we are \nadvancing a pilot across five of our sites to test the use of non-\nanimal alternatives. At the same time, we are engaging with \nregulators to support wider uptake of these alternatives. \nUntil horseshoe crab blood can be fully replaced, we are working \nwith our suppliers to improve sustainability. Our new Sustainable \nSourcing Standards, discussed above, include a specific Marine \nSustainable Sourcing Standard which outlines the requirements that \nour suppliers of marine-derived materials must adhere to. We \nconducted physical site audits of key suppliers in 2023 to understand \nadoption of this standard.\nAtmosphere\nAir quality is closely linked to climate change, as many of the \ndrivers of air pollution, such as burning fossil fuels, are also sources \nof greenhouse gas emissions. Air pollution is a significant risk to \nhuman health, particularly for patients with respiratory conditions \nlike asthma and COPD. \nOur approach to air pollution includes reducing pollutants linked \nto burning fossil fuels that will be addressed via our SBTi-aligned \nclimate targets (set out on page 18), as well as looking more \nbroadly at our air pollution footprint.\nTo help accelerate collective action on air pollution, we are \nmembers of the Alliance for Clean Air through the Clean Air Fund \n(CAF) and the World Economic Forum, which aims to drive \ncorporate action on clean air to accelerate climate action and \ncreate healthy communities around the world.\nWe have done an initial assessment to establish an air pollution \nfootprint in our operations and our supply chain. This highlighted \nopportunities for reductions in emissions linked to on-site \nelectricity generation and use of solid fuels, car use and move to \nelectric fleet, as well as indicating opportunities in our value chain \nfor the sourcing of plastic and glass products. We are creating \nreduction plans around these key areas that are aligned to our \npathway to zero and which aim to have a positive impact on air \nquality.\nWe are conducting an additional air quality assessment, working \nwith Stockholm Environment Institute (SEI) and the University of \nYork, broadening the suite of air pollutants to be taken into \nconsideration to understand their impact across our value chain \nand their connection to human health. \n1  Including a 20% reduction in routine hazardous and non-hazardous waste.\n2  Where regulatory obligations allow, excluding plastics that are critical to product discovery and development, and health and safety.\nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

We have set \na target to help accelerate the adoption of this approach:\n \u2013 25% environmental impact reduction for our products and \npackaging by 2030 \nWe have also set targets to reduce operational and supply  \nchain waste:\n \u2013 Zero operational waste,1 including eliminating single-use \nplastics2 by 2030 \n \u2013 10% waste reduction from our supply chain by 2030\nProduct stewardship\nOur approach to product stewardship across both new and \nexisting products is built on a scientific method for environmental \nfootprinting called life cycle assessment (LCA). We worked with \nexternal specialists to co-develop an internal product carbon \nfootprinting tool, building on the LCA process, that covers both \nclimate and nature to inform our scientists and engineers when \nthey develop new products. We also use publicly available tools \nwhen we need to share information outside of GSK.\nTo embed sustainability into the design of all our future products, \nwe have developed a set of eco-design principles to help guide \nthe decision-making. \nWe are actively working as part of a consortium of eight global \npharmaceutical that have come together via the Pharmaceutical \nEnvironment Group (PEG), with support from the SMI, to co-\ndevelop a shared way of measuring and reporting environmental \nproduct data. \nSince 2022, we have completed an LCA analysis for 22 products, \nwhich has enabled us to identify where we need to improve \nmanufacturing design, to assess potential savings from design \nchanges and to provide product-level information to key \ncustomers on specific products. \n100% of GSK sites are now manufacturing PVC-free secondary \nand tertiary packaging. We also implemented our first pilot of \nelectronic patient information, to replace paper leaflets in \nSingapore.\nA solvent reduction strategy is being rolled out across our sites \nand key suppliers. This includes designing out solvents, using lower \nimpact solvents, and improving solvent recovery rates.\nWaste \nIn 2023, we reduced operational waste by 1% compared with \n2022, a total of 21% since 2020.1 We increased the amount of \nmaterials recovered by circular routes to 53%. \nWe have maintained zero operational waste to landfill and we \ncontinue to build on our long-standing operational waste \nmanagement programme to identify opportunities to find more \nbeneficial uses for waste. \nFor example, at our wastewater treatment facility in Jurong and at \nour site in Marburg, Germany, we are reducing the amount of \nwaste incinerated. \nFor our supply chain, we\u2019re working on a waste footprint \nassessment to help with supplier engagement on waste reduction.\nInvesting in nature \nInvesting in nature protection and restoration is a key part of our \nambition and commitment to achieve a net zero, nature positive, \nhealthier planet. We aim to do this by making investments in \nnature across our value chain. We are also prioritising nature \ninvestments for the carbon credits we are committed to securing \nas part of our pathway to net zero emissions.\nOur approach is to partner with expert developers, investors and \nNGOs to invest in early-stage nature projects for the long term. \nGSK is an investor in Climate Asset Management\u2019s Nature Based \nCarbon Fund, which aims to invest at a landscape scale in \ngrassland, agriculture, forestry, wetlands and coastal carbon \nprojects in developing economies, to provide long-lasting, verified, \npositive impact at scale for the climate, biodiversity and local \ncommunities. This is a long-term investment over the next 15 years, \nwhich aims to secure approximately a quarter of credits that we \nneed in 2030, to meet our commitment to invest in nature-based \nsolutions for 20% of our 2020 footprint.\nTo help ensure that human health is a key outcome of the world\u2019s \ndrive to protect and restore nature, in September 2023, we \npublished an open-source toolkit in partnership with Pollination, \ndeveloped with input from key nature and health experts from \norganisations such as the Circular Bioeconomy Alliance, the \nNature Climate Solutions Alliance and the London School of \nHygiene and Tropical Medicine. The toolkit aims to support \ncompanies, investors and developers to incorporate health \nconsiderations in the design of nature-based projects. We will  \nbe seeking to test the toolkit in some of the nature investments \nthat we make.\n1   Methodology changed in 2023 to only include waste and materials leaving our sites.\n2  Where regulatory obligations allow, excluding plastics that are critical to product discovery and development, and health and safety.\nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

Our clinical trials need to \nreflect the populations affected by the diseases we are aiming to \naddress. Backed by the latest scientific research, we are working \nto make sure we recruit participants to our clinical trials in line with \nthe epidemiology of the diseases in question. \nBeing an inclusive business will make the most of our people\u2019s \npotential and increase our positive impact. Our culture should allow \nall our people to thrive, we want all our leadership to reflect our GSK \npeople and our people to reflect the communities we work and hire \nin. Diversity brings better insights and better-quality decision-\nmaking to help us perform better and understand our diverse \npatients. We want a truly inclusive working environment where all \nemployees can be themselves and their diverse perspectives and \ncharacteristics are valued so they can thrive, perform at their best \nand help us get ahead of disease together. \nTo build a diverse workforce, we need a diverse pool of job \napplicants \u2013 so we are working to improve access to STEM \neducation among under-represented communities. These efforts \nextend from community programmes and secondary education, \nthrough working with universities to mentoring young people \nbeginning their careers. \nClinical trial diversity\nDiseases and medicines can affect people differently depending \non ethnicity, sex, race and age. This means it is important to \nensure that the patients and people enrolled in our clinical trials \nrepresent the real-world patient/people population that will use \nour medicines and vaccines and represent those affected by the \ndisease under study.\nWe continue to make progress in advancing clinical trial diversity.  \nIn addition to ensuring 100% of our phase III trials have diversity \nplans in place to enrol the groups most affected by the disease \nbeing studied, based on disease epidemiology, we also are \nchallenging ourselves to actively monitor patient recruitment in  \nreal time to ensure that we reach our diversity goals. We met our \nobjective of 100% of the phase III interventional trials initiated in \n2023 having proactive diversity plans. \nIn February 2023, we published a study of 17 years of GSK and \nViiV Healthcare US clinical trial diversity data.

In 2023, we increased investments  \nwith select suppliers in marketing, sales and technology. In \naddition, we significantly increased partnerships with external \nadvocacy groups, deepened relationships with key existing \ndiverse suppliers, and onboarded new diverse suppliers.\nThis year, we expanded our successful US supplier diversity \nprogramme to the UK. This programme provides opportunities to \nunder-represented groups, including women, ethnic minorities, \nmembers of the LGBTQ+ community, people with disabilities and \nmilitary veterans, as well as small businesses in high-\nunemployment, low-income communities.\nSupporting an inclusive culture\nOur Code requires all our people to commit to being inclusive and \naware of their impact on others. Our annual mandatory training \non Creating an Inclusive Workplace sets out the standards we \nexpect. \n gsk.com: The Code \nBuilding a diverse organisation \nWe are fundamentally committed to equal employment \nopportunity and non-discrimination for all employees and we \nwant all our leadership to reflect our GSK people and our people \nto reflect the communities we work and hire in. That is why we \nhave set leadership aspirations for race and ethnicity in senior \npositions in the US and UK and gender aspirations for senior \npositions globally.  To support this, we ensure that our recruitment \nand selection processes are fair and equitable to all. \nFor vacancies in our senior grades, we expect diverse shortlists \nand interview panels by gender and ethnicity. We are working \nwith recruitment agencies, our internal Employee Resource \nGroups and specialist organisations to drive progress. Hiring \nmanagers are required to complete inclusive interview training \nbefore they start selection processes. \nAt the end of 2023, women held 45% of VP-and-above roles \nglobally, compared with 42% in 2022. Women made up 48% of all \nemployees in 2023, and 50% of all management roles. \nIn countries that meet our criteria for data confidentiality and \nanonymity, we disclose the race and ethnicity of our people  \nat each level and set aspirations for leadership representation \nwhich reflect available talent, our employee population and \nexternal communities. Currently, the UK and the US meet those \ncriteria.\nIn the UK at the end of 2023, we had 18.4% ethnically diverse \nleaders at VP-and-above, compared with 14.3% in 2022. We had \n1.9% Black leaders at VP level and above compared with 1.6% in \n2022. In the US at the end of 2023, we had 35.7% ethnically \ndiverse leaders at VP-and-above, compared with 31.3% in 2022. \nWe had 8.1% Black or African American leaders at VP-and-above \ncompared with 8.6% in 2022. We had 6.4% Hispanic or Latinx \nleaders at VP-and-above compared with 6.4% in 2022. \nWe are working to ensure that we have a representative pool  \nof job applicants from which to hire. In the US, we continue to \nengage with Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and \nHispanic Serving Institutions, and our employee alumni, to \nencourage applications for our graduate and experienced hire \npositions and target recruitment campaigns to reach under-\nrepresented groups.\nA highly talented and diverse team is essential to help us get \nahead of disease together. Our fair and equitable pay practices \nhelp ensure we create an environment where people feel \nwelcome, valued, included, and supported to thrive. We  \nconduct country-based reviews and ensure all markets have  \nclear guidance, tools, and support to ensure pay equity. If \nunexplained differences are detected, we address them through \nour compensation processes. Our focus on pay equity while \nbuilding a diverse organisation helps us to deliver strong UK  \npay gap results. \nOur 2023 gender pay gap for all permanent UK-based GSK \nemployees is -0.50% (mean), compared to the national average \nof 13.2%. This is the second time that we\u2019re reporting our UK \nethnicity pay gap comparing the average pay of our White and \nEthnically Diverse employees. Our 2023 UK ethnicity pay gap for \nall permanent UK-based GSK employees is -0.74% (mean), \ncompared with 0.06% in 2022. \nIn addition, within our 2023 UK ethnicity pay gap report we are \nalso sharing the pay gaps comparing the average pay of our \nWhite employees with those in the ethnic groupings of Black, \nMixed, Asian, and Other.

This builds trust in what \nwe do, protects our business and helps create a workplace where \nwe all thrive. How we do things is as important as what we do. \nOur Code of Conduct (The Code) reflects our purpose to unite \nscience, technology and talent to get ahead of disease together. \nIt sets out the commitments we make as a company and to each \nother to deliver on our purpose and ambition. The Code is \nsupported by additional global policies and standards, which  \ncan be found in our Code Hub. We have an accompanying global \nmandatory learning curriculum, Living our Code, which all our \npeople are required to complete, comprising three modules:  \nThe Code, Creating an Inclusive Workplace and Protecting GSK. \nProtecting GSK focuses on key areas such as anti-bribery and \ncorruption (ABAC), information and cyber security, privacy, \nreporting human safety information related to our products, and \nour Speak Up integrity lines. In 2023, 100% of our employees and \n99% of complementary workers completed this training where \ndue by year end. \nWe have additional ABAC training for our people in certain \nhigh-risk roles or geographic regions.

We continue \nto make progress in integrating them within our operations and \nhow we conduct our business. \nWe are signatories to the UN Global Compact and our Human \nRights Position Statement lays out our commitment to the UN \nGuiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. We have a \ncross-business Human Rights Steering Group, which reports to  \nthe GSK Leadership Team and Board\u2019s Corporate Responsibility \nCommittee, and drives progress on human rights impacts and \nrisks across the business. \nIn 2023, we carried out human rights training for priority suppliers, \naimed at ensuring a good understanding of human rights and \nlabour principles, aligned with international standards. We also \ncontinued our human rights training for procurement and third-\nparty engagement leads, to better equip them to spot human \nrights issues when visiting suppliers. \nWe conduct audits and site visits covering EHS and labour rights \nfor our priority suppliers.1 Some of the issues identified during \nsupplier visits in 2023 related to policy, wages and compliance.  \nAll observations have action plans in place to drive improvement, \nwhich are tracked and followed up for completion.\nWe are committed to fair and equitable pay, ensuring that all \nemployees globally receive pay that is competitive in their local \nmarkets and sufficient to support a sustainable standard of living. \nIn 2023, the Fair Wage Network certified GSK as a Living Wage \nemployer, after it reviewed the global gap analysis we conducted \nin 2022. It confirmed that all GSK workers are paid at or above the \nliving wage in their relevant markets.

It is important to \nmanage our relationships with them well, including the way we \nchoose, contract and monitor them. \nOur third-party risk management programme provides the \nframework by which we manage and oversee risks associated \nwith the third parties we engage to provide goods or services.  \nWe expect our third parties to comply with applicable laws and \nregulations and to adopt, at minimum, our ABAC and labour \nrights principles and, where relevant, to comply with our standards \non quality, patient safety, health and safety, and the environment.  \nAll expectations are formalised in contracts and subject to \nappropriate levels of audit and oversight. All new suppliers \nundergo a risk assessment and all existing suppliers are re-\nassessed once every three years on average. Appropriate action \nis taken against those third parties found in breach of their \nundertakings.  \nWe assess all our third parties to understand whether we consider \nthem to be low, medium or high risk. Our high-risk third parties are \ndetermined by location in high-risk markets, size of spend and \ntype of goods or services. They are mostly goods and services \nproviders (62%), distributors and wholesalers (3%), direct material \nsuppliers (3%) and contract manufacturers (1%). In 2023, we \nassessed our high-risk third parties, totalling over 7,500 \nassessments across 17 risk areas. We also use tools to assess how \nsuppliers manage risks, including EcoVadis desktop assessments. \nAdditionally, to further support ongoing oversight of our third \nparties and suppliers, we have additional controls and monitoring \nprogrammes to ensure they meet our standards and \nrequirements.  For example, we include controls as relevant in  \nour principal risks to manage third-party risk, which differs by \nbusiness area according to the third-party risk profiles. Teams  \nin our Global Supply Chain business are responsible for on-site \nsupplier visits and audits, periodic business review and \nperformance meetings, and annual or semi-annual enterprise-\nlevel governance. In R&D, we have an established third-party \nmonitoring programme to assess compliance with our policies \nand standards.

We visit sites, in person  \nor virtually, to help suppliers better understand and control their \nrisks. This year, we conducted 73 physical visits across 63 priority \nsuppliers.2 \nWe conducted 47 supplier audits following industry standard \nPharmaceutical Supply Chain Initiative guidelines. We trained \nmore than 1,000 supplier employees on EHS and ESG \nfundamentals this year, strengthened EHS contractual obligations \nand have worked with suppliers to help them improve their \nEcoVadis scores. We introduced a process to pause supply if a \nthird party has a significant EHS incident, and the decision on \nwhether to restart or discontinue work with the third party \ndepends on completion of an improvement plan and trajectory. \nWe also introduced an EHS risk app-based questionnaire for GSK \nvisitors to a third party as part of our monitoring activities, which \ngenerate improvement actions that we track through to \ncompletion.\n  gsk.com: Our position on working with third parties  \u2022 Annual Report \n2023 \u2022 Principal risks and uncertainties pages 230-240\nUsing data and AI responsibly \nData is an essential foundation to realising our ambitions for \npatients.

We have additional governance boards  \nthat oversee the use of our data in the research, development, \nmanufacture and supply of our products to ensure we follow \nregulations and meet ethical obligations. \nIn 2023, we created cross-functional AI Governance Council to \noversee our AI strategy and to ensure responsible adoption of  \nAI/ML. This is complemented by an internal policy to ensure that \nAI/ML adoption is safe and aligned with GSK\u2019s culture by \nestablishing AI Principles, which are underpinned by the ethical \nstandards set out in the GSK Code. The AI Governance Council is \nresponsible for enforcing our AI Principles and monitoring the \nexternal AI/ML landscape to anticipate potential risks to GSK.  \nWe have also published a public policy position on responsible AI \nto set out our views, commitments and asks of policymakers.

Disciplinary action was taken within the year.\n2  In 2022, we updated the reporting methodology for the breakdown of types of policy violation to provide more granularity by case class as there was a \nbroader distribution from the top five policy area categories historically reported under 'other'. To enable comparison, prior year data has been restated using \nthe new reporting methodology.\n3  In 2022, we changed our process for the circumstances that trigger discipline for late completion of mandatory training, now reported under employee \nconduct. As a result, we saw fewer disciplinary cases in 2022 compared to prior years.\n4  In 2023 changes from prior years are reflective of several factors including external geopolitical and economic issues affecting some countries which changes \nthe nature of concerns raised and, internally, our continued emphasis on appropriate management and closure of cases, correlating in an increase in these \nareas.\n5  In 2023, policy violation class type name changed from Computer and data-breach security to Cyber Security, content/classification remains the same and \ntherefore data is comparable year on year.\n6  The majority of EHS and sustainability category increases in 2022 were written warnings related to compliance with the company's COVID-19 vaccination \nmandate, safety or testing requirements, to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of our workforce, which were subsequently lifted in April 2023, correlating \nin a decrease in 2023.\n7  These figures are based on active employees and complementary workers at year end. Data from 2020-21 is split between employees and complementary \nworkers, as disclosed in our prior ESG reports, and rounded to the nearest whole number. 2020-21 also includes data from our previous Consumer Healthcare \nbusiness; due to attrition over the last three years, restating completion rates would not provide a comparable metric. \n8   In 2022, we updated the way in which we report completion of mandatory training by combining metrics for employees and complementary workers across \nthe mandatory trainings into a single metric, rounded to the nearest whole number.\nEthical standards continuedEthical standards continued\n2020 2021 2022 2023\nEthical conduct1\nEmployees who had concerns raised against them (including current year and prior year  \nopen cases)\n2,105 2,534 2,191 1,960         A\nEmployees disciplined for policy violations 553 910 850 798         A\nBreakdown of types of policy violation 2\nEmployee conduct3 268 555 367 304         A\nSales and marketing 63 166 168 122         A\nProduct quality 85 65 48 76         A\nSafeguarding people and information and assets 60 78 140 177         A\nEmployee relations and HR policies 18 20 42 994\n        A\nR&D and medical practices 7 13 13 7         A\nAnti-bribery and corruption 8 22 12 394\n        A\nCyber security 27 9 14 245\n        A\nEHS and sustainability 9 16 152 646\n        A\nOther 17 5 4 4         A\nEmployees who were dismissed or agreed to leave the company voluntarily as a result of \nmisconduct\n103 177 290 256         A\nDocumented warnings 455 740 566 553         A\nOpen cases awaiting investigation or a disciplinary decision at year end 617 636 457 297         A\nMandatory training7\n% of employees and complementary workers that complete GSK\u2019s mandatory training 8 \u2013 \u2013 99% 100%  PR  A\n% of employees that complete GSK\u2019s mandatory training \u2013 The Code: Living our Values and \nExpectations (2019, 2020); Working at GSK (2021)\n100% 99% 100% 100%\n% of complementary workers that complete GSK\u2019s mandatory training \u2013 The Code: Living our \nValues and Expectations (2019, 2020); Working at GSK (2021)\n97% 93% 98% 99%\n% of employees that complete GSK\u2019s mandatory training \u2013 ABAC 100% 100% 100% 100%\n% of complementary workers that complete GSK\u2019s mandatory training \u2013 ABAC 100% 99% 96% 99%\nReporting concerns\n% of employees who believe they \u2018can and do Speak Up if things don\u2019t feel right\u2019 \u2013 87% 87% 83%  PR  A\nSuppliers\n% of direct high-risk suppliers that achieve GSK\u2019s minimum EcoVadis score or have an \nimprovement plan in place\n53% 80% 82% 89%  PR  A\nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

The data is \ncaptured according to the Wholesale Acquisition Cost of the medicine or \nvaccine and is coded as \u2018Free Good Charitable Orders\u2019.\u202fThis amount is \nconverted to a \u2018Cost of Goods Sold\u2019 amount for reporting purposes. \n Patient participation varies annually based on current program eligibility \ncriteria, overall healthcare environmental factors and products included in \nthe programs.  \nDoses of Rotarix, \nSynflorix and Cervarix \nvaccines supplied to \nGavi (millions) \nThe number of doses of the Rotarix, Synflorix and \nCervarix vaccine that are supplied to Gavi, the \nVaccine Alliance. \nTo calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK \ndoses shipped to Gavi supported countries.  \nGSK has been a Gavi supplier since Gavi\u2019s inception in 2000.\nDoses of Mosquirix \n(RTS,S/AS01 E) \nvaccines supplied \n(millions)\nThe number of doses of the Mosquirix (RTS,S/\nAS01 E) vaccine GSK donated to the Malaria \nVaccine Implementation Programme (MVIP) \nand number of Gavi funded doses supplied \nthrough Gavi-Unicef \nTo calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the number of GSK \ndoses procured by UNICEF for MVIP and Gavi funded supply.\u202f\nGSK has supplied/donated 10 million Mosquirix (RTS,S/AS01 E), since the \nbeginning of the MVIP in 2019 and has supplied the first Gavi funded doses \nfrom Q4-2023.\nDoses of OPV \nvaccines ready-to-\nship stockpile for \noutbreak responses to \nUNICEF (millions)\nThe number of doses of the OPV vaccine that \nare ready-to-ship stockpile for outbreak \nresponses to UNICEF.\nTo calculate the number of doses in the OPV stockpile, we use the number \nof mOPV2 doses stored in GSK warehouse for outbreak responses.\nDoses of OPV \nvaccines supplied to \nUNICEF (millions)\nThe number of doses of the OPV vaccine that \nare supplied to UNICEF.\nTo calculate the number of doses supplied, we use the total number of GSK \ndoses shipped to countries procuring via UNICEF for both routine \nvaccination campaigns and outbreak responses. \nPeople with access to \na generic dolutegravir \nproduct through \nvoluntary licensing \nagreements (\u2018000) \nThe total number of people living with HIV \ncurrently accessing generic dolutegravir-based \nproducts through ViiV Healthcare\u2019s voluntary \nlicensing agreements with the Medicines Patent \nPool and directly with Aurobindo Pharma. \nAs a chronic and ongoing treatment, we capture the cumulative number of \npeople with access to dolutegravir, rather than annual data, to avoid \nduplication. The indicator therefore represents the total number of people \nliving with HIV accessing the treatment at the time of measurement. As a \nlife-long treatment, this number incorporates people that have been \nreceiving ongoing treatment for multiple years. \nFor adults living with HIV, the number is calculated by adding the total \nnumber of packs of all generic dolutegravir-based products (indicated for \nadults) sold over the previous four quarters. This is then divided by twelve to \nobtain average monthly sales and estimate the number of adults on \ntreatment. \nFor children living with HIV, this is done by calculating the total number of \npaediatric DTG 10mg tablets sold over the previous four quarters and \ndividing this by 365 to calculate average number of tablets sold per day. \nThis is then divided by 2.056 (the average daily number of tablets taken \nacross different paediatric weight bands) to estimate the number of \nchildren on treatment. \nIn both cases, packs of 90 and 60 are converted to 30 pack equivalents \n(i.e. monthly equivalents for a daily treatment). \nData is provided by the Medicines Patent Pool and Aurobindo, through \nwhich ViiV\u2019s DTG patents are (sub-)licensed. \nOur approach         Access         Global health        Environment         DEI         Ethical standards         Product governance         Appendix",

These observations do \nnot affect our conclusion set out above.\nSelected Information\nThe scope and boundary of our work is restricted to the metrics included within the Report for the current reporting year (the \u201cSelected \nInformation\u201d), listed below and in the Appendix:\n\u2022 The Environmental Social and Governance (ESG) performance data listed in the Appendix of this document. \n\u2022 The overall 2023 ESG Performance Rating score of \u201con track\u201d relating to GSK\u2019s performance against the 2023 Performance Rating metrics \nlisted on pages 6 and 7 of the Report.\nTo assess the Selected Information, which includes an assessment of the risk of material misstatement in the Report, we have used GSK\u2019s ESG \nData Collection Process and Controls Documents which are summarised in the ESG reporting criteria (the \u201cCriteria\u201d), which can be found from \npages 47 to 54 of the Report.\nWe have not performed any work, and do not express any conclusion, on any other information that may be published in the Report or on \nGSK\u2019s website for the current reporting period or for previous periods. \nStandard and level of assurance \nWe performed a limited assurance engagement of specified data and information using \nDNV\u2019s assurance methodology VerisustainTM, which is based on our professional \nexperience and international assurance best practice including the International \nStandard on Assurance Engagements (ISAE) 3000 \u2013 \u2018Assurance Engagements other than \nAudits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information\u2019 (revised) issued by the \nInternational Auditing and Assurance Standards Board. This methodology ensures \ncompliance with ethical requirements and mandates planning and execution of the \nassurance engagement to obtain a limited level of assurance.\nDNV applies its own management standards and compliance policies for quality control, \nwhich are based on the principles enclosed within ISO IEC 17029:2019 - Conformity \nAssessment - General principles and requirements for validation and verification bodies, \nand accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including \ndocumented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, \nprofessional standards, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nThe procedures performed in a limited assurance engagement vary in nature and are \nshorter in extent than for a reasonable assurance engagement. Consequently, the level of \nassurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the \nassurance that would have been obtained if a reasonable assurance engagement had \nbeen performed. \nDNV established policies and procedures are \ndesigned to ensure that DNV, its personnel \nand, where applicable, others are subject to \nindependence requirements (including \npersonnel of other entities of DNV) and \nmaintain independence where required by \nrelevant ethical requirements.
